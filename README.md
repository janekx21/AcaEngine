The game has 4 different states:
 - Starting from the start menue you can reach the other three scenes via button clicking. You can then return to the start menue by pressing escape.
  
 - The orange button leads you to the horizontal spring scene in which you can observe harmonic oscillation of planets around the z-axis.
  
 - The blue button leads you to the shooter scene. By clicking the left mouse button you can fire planets as projectiles on a group of reappearing crates. If you aimed correctly and the projectile collides with a target, the target will dissappear. Clicking the right mouse button unleashes the spray mode in which the projectiles are spread randomly in a cone. 
  
 - The white button leads you to our example scene. Here you can experience ambient occlusion. Holding space bar will show you the scene without ambient occlusion.

You can leave the game from the start menue by pressing escape.
